## File Encryption Program (cstore)
This folder contains my code from a file encryption project (cstore) used to encrypt and store files locally using AES encryption. The program had four main functionalities: add files to an archive, delete files from an archive, list the files in an archive, and extract (decrypt) files from an archive.
